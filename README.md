## CSE 478 Fall 2022 Group Project

This semester, we researched the idea of correlation throughout various markets and assets. More specifically, we designed a "Correlation Moving Average Indicator", what we have coined "CORRMA", and created various algorithms to test if it may be used in a profitable trading manner. 

We have various results and codes throughout the repo. Please feel free to take a look, leave feedback, and try them yourself!
